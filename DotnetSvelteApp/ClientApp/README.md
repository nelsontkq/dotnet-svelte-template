# Svelte Frontend

This is the Svelte frontend for the .NET application. It uses SvelteKit with TypeScript and Vite.

## Development

The frontend is integrated with the .NET backend. To start development:

1. Run the .NET application from the root directory:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

2. The Svelte development server will start automatically with hot reloading.

## Building

The frontend build is handled by the .NET build process. No separate build step is needed.
